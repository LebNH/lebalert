<h1>LebAlert Service</h1>
The tool used by the City of Lebanon to alert residents and businesses of issues relating to public safety and/or City operations. Subscribers receive up-to-the-minute bulletins announcing emergency notices, road closures, public safety news, and more. The service is located at: http://alert.lebnh.net.

<h2>Overview</h2>
The current LebAlert system runs with an RPC link between Google Sheets and Google App Engine (GAE) which parses spreadsheet data in order to send emails to a subscriber base and post pulic announcements to the City's website. Additional services, such as social feed, are also triggered after the script has successfully completed. 

In progress... trying to migrate project to Github where we can more easily work with it.
